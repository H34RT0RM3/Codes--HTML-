        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>My name is Nahyan Ibn Hasan, and I am a student of Hello Kids International School. I am currently studying in Grade 4, and I created this website at this young age! Ever since I started using computers, I became very interested in how websites, apps, and games are made. That curiosity inspired me to learn about coding and technology. I enjoy learning new things, solving problems, and being creative with computers. One day, I want to become a professional software engineer and build amazing apps, websites, and programs that can help people around the world. I know it's a big dream, but I'm ready to work hard and keep learning until I achieve it. This is my first personal website, and I made it when I was in Grade 4. I'm really excited to share it with you!</h4>
        <h5>My Experiences</h5>
        <h6>I have a lot of experience playing different types of games, and over time, they have become a big part of my life. My favorite types of games are parkour, racing, and creative building games. These games are not only fun but also very helpful for developing skills like thinking, planning, and solving problems quickly.

One of the games I enjoy the most is Minecraft. In Minecraft, I explore big worlds, build amazing structures, and play parkour maps that test my jumping and timing skills. It teaches me how to use logic and creativity to solve puzzles and build things that look cool and work well.

Another game I really like is Crashday Redline Edition. It’s a fast-paced racing game where I can drive cars, crash, do stunts, and enjoy powerful action. I love how the game feels realistic, and it gives me the excitement of driving while also needing fast thinking and quick reactions.

Roblox is also one of my top favorite games. Roblox is not just one game—it’s thousands of games in one! I can play obstacle courses, adventure missions, racing, and even role-play. I also like that many Roblox games are made by other kids and teenagers.

Through these games, I've learned more than just how to play—I've learned how to focus better, how to make fast decisions, how to think logically, and how to be creative. I've even started to understand some basic coding ideas by seeing how these games work.

Gaming has also improved my hand-eye coordination, teamwork, and patience. When I fail a level or challenge, I don't give up—I try again and again until I get better.

Overall, playing Minecraft, Crashday Redline Edition, and Roblox has been a fun and educational experience. I don't just play to win—I play to learn, to improve, and to get inspired. These games helped me discover my love for technology, and they are a big reason why I want to become a software engineer in the future.</h6>
